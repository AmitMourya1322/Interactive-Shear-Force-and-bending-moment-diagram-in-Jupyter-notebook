# Interactive-Shear-Force-and-bending-moment-diagram-in-Jupyter-notebook
In this blog we are going to learn how to shear force and bending moment diagram of a simple supported beam in jupyter notebook.  Note : While making this code I have  used the absolute coordinate system and relative coordinate system  First i have  -import numpy  for math calculation -matplotlib for graph plotting -ipywidgets to make interactive graph in Jupyter notebook  In our case i am using simply support beam so first thing i have do is define the length of the beam . The starting point of the beam(s_b)  and ending point of beam(e_b)  .The value will be read as (0,0) and (10,0) as  straight line this line represent straight beam.  Now we have to define a function with a variable that can be used as  slider in my case the function name is fd(force downward) and the parameter is x (distance from the left side).
